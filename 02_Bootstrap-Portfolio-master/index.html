                    I enrolled in the University of Adelaide Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, not to change career or get a job, but to learn web full stack development as part of a skill I need to code the end user device software
                    for an industrial IoT (Internet of Things) tracking product in development at Assisttech an innovation technology company, of which I am the owner. I have designed the tracker electronics, edge data handling
                    with embedded controller programmed in C, specified the LoRaWAN network system and, importantly, conducted extensive market research to determine/validate need and market size. I could employ a developer but 
                    being a typical engineer, decided to learn full stack web development myself! Eventually, I will probably hire a full stack developer as business expands.<br><br>
                    My professional background is engineering (electro-mechanical to biomedical) and graduate business studies (Innovation and Entrepreneurship).  Throughout my biomedical engineering career, I developed an early CPAP
                    machine (form of positive airway pressure ventilator), designed and developed a multi-cell proportional counter for measuring genetic sequences, developed ISO 9001 Design and Development Quality Procedures, pioneered
                    AS/NZS 3551 electromedical equipment testing standards and in addition to many other projects, employed user-centred design methodology to develop a wheelchair mounted head controlled robotic arm .<br><br>
                    My biggest takeaway from the business studies, apart from accounting and finance, was marketing, and learning how it is a critical function for success, be it, personal success or commercial success. In1998, I won two
                    Enterprise Workshop annual awards for Best Business plan and Best Marketing Plan for a real-life business venture. This was in conjunction with my studies at UniSA Graduate School of Business. More recent studies
                    undertaken include Digital Marketing, Brand Positioning and Entrepreneurial Negotiation. Next step is a likely MBA.<br><br>
                    In addition to engineering, I am business manager for Absolutely Fabulous Corporate, a successful corporate uniform fashion business that my wife started many years ago. We proudly manufacture all uniforms
                    locally and have contracts with several companies including one national airline that, fortunately, is not affected by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is continuous innovation, total customer focus and, importantly,
                    keeping up with economic, technological and societal trends that propels our company to enduring success.
